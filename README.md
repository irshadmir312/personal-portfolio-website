Hello! I'm Irshad Majeed Mir, a dedicated and enthusiastic BTech graduate in Computer Science, with a passion for developing innovative solutions through coding and project development. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in data science at Aston University, and I freelance to support a variety of client needs in software and web development.
